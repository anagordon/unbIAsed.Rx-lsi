To run the web application, make sure to turn on the virtual environment (venv), to have the proper requirements installed. <br>
Add python code in the code.py file. Add all code in the index() function. See example on how variables are passed into the front-end (HTML). <br>
The HTML format can be edited in templates/home.html.<br>
Always turn on venv before starting to code.<br>


Steps When Coding:

1. 'Pull' on github desktop
2. Turn on venv (activate)
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Write code (YAY)
5. If you added any new imports, update list (see below, with -m)
6. To run website, python3 main.py
7. Once you're done editing/writing code, 'Commit' with a message
8. Then, 'Push'

How to turn on virtual environment (venv):
- mac: source .venv/bin/activate
- non-mac (aka powershell): .venv\Scripts\Activate

To update requirements list (if new imports were added, always do this out of practice):
- in the terminal of VS Code
- python -m pip install package-name

Add openai key (since it is not pushed in the repo)

To run app:
- in terminal: python3 main.py
