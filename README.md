Welcome to UnbIAsed-Rx's new machine learning module! To see our current website (not yet updated with the new module), visit [unbiased-rx.com]([http://unbiased-rx.com).

To run the web application, make sure to turn on the virtual environment (venv), to have the proper requirements installed. <br>
Add python code in the code.py file. Add all code in the index() function. See example on how variables are passed into the front-end (HTML). <br>
The HTML format can be edited in templates/home.html.<br>
Always turn on .venv before starting to code.<br>

How to turn on virtual environment (venv):
- mac: source .venv/bin/activate
- non-mac (aka powershell): .venv\Scripts\Activate

To update requirements list (if new imports were added, always do this out of practice):
- in the terminal of VS Code
- python -m pip install package-name

Add openai key (since it is not pushed in the repo)

To run app:
- in terminal: python3 main.py
