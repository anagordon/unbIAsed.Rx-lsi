Welcome to UnbIAsed-Rx's new machine learning module! To see our current website (not yet updated with the new module), visit [unbiased-rx.com](http://unbiased-rx.com). Our website's repository can be found at [https://github.com/thuy-n/unbIAsed.Rx](https://github.com/thuy-n/unbIAsed.Rx).

To run the web application, make sure to turn on the virtual environment (new_venv), to have the proper requirements installed. <br>
Always turn on new_venv before starting to code.<br>

How to turn on virtual environment (new_venv):
- mac: source new_venv/bin/activate
- non-mac (aka powershell): new_venv\Scripts\Activate

To update requirements list (if new imports were added, always do this out of practice):
- in the terminal of VS Code
- python -m pip install package-name

Add openai key (since it is not pushed in the repo)

To run app:
- in terminal: python3 main.py
